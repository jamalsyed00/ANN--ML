# ANN--ML
Machine Learning Assignment-2a

To predict labels for a series of attributes, the model employs an Artificial Neural Network. This model is used to classify from multiple classes that are not linearly separable. A two layer ANN was deployed. The biases are set to 0 and the weights are initialised from a regular normal distribution. Gradient Descent and Backpropagation were used to update the parameters. Log loss function was the metric used to verify the accuracy of the model. Training accuracy of ~76% and a testing accuracy of ~75% was achieved.
